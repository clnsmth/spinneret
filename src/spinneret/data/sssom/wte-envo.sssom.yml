mapping_set_description: This mapping set is a manually curated alignment of the United States Geological Survey World Terrestrial Ecosystems (WTE) 2020 data product (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9DO61LP). Property alignment was created using the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM; https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/home/). The motivation of this mapping is to facilitate the classification of ecosystems via geospatial coordinates (point, multipoint, polyline, polygon, envelope) for dataset annotation to improve search and discovery by potential data users. A high degree of precision was attempted. Note, the WTE terminology is not a part of a formal vocabulary/ontology with web resolvable entities. Therefore, values in the subject_id field of the wte-envo.sssom.tsv (CURIEs), will not be web resolvable once expanded. The curie_map property for WTE below, lists the authoritative definitions for the mapped WTE ecosystem attributes, which takes the form of a research article. Also note, currently, there are few ENVO equivalents for the WTE Climate Region categories however, the climate regions are each composed of a temperature domain and a moisture domain, which do have matching ENVO classifications. Therefore, these components, and their corresponding ENVO matches, are listed in the SSSOM table to enable the construction of composite ENVO classifications. The integration of WTE climate regions into ENVO has yet to be determined.
